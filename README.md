# Welcome to Humble Ponderings ðŸ’­

Thanks for checking out Humber Ponderings!

Ponderings provides a random writing prompt from a custom database and the user can enter a short little musing. This input will be displayed and stored, and then can be edited, deleted or pinned at any time.

This project was created for Juno College of Technology in Toronto, to show an understanding of core React concepts and Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service as applied to larger applications. Thanks for visiting!
